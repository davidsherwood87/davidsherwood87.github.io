# Core Programming by David Sherwood

## About The Author

Having completed my Bachelors degree in Environmental Studies with the Open University
in 2013, i decided in 2014 to become a teacher. I decided to study my PGCE at the
University of Sunderland, and passed the course the following year in 2015. Having spent
a year as a full time teacher, i decided it was not really for me and looked at different
avenues to pursue. I had always had a passion for Geography throughout my life and was 
very keen on statistics and maps. So in 2017 i decided to once again become a distance-learning
student at the University of Leeds, studying GIS. I am currently in my second year of the course
and am in my final module of year 2. My previous modules this year have included:
1. Remote Sensing
2. Planning
3. Population and demographic analysis

### Why Programming?

As probably noted by the amount of emails i have sent my tutor, my experience in Python has
been so far very limited, with some experience coming from teaching Computer Science whilst
a cover teacher. 

Wanting to find a new career, i have noticed that a lot of jobs in the sector want Python 
experience, and so i chose this course to gain at least some experience in programming.
